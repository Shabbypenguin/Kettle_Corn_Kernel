VPNClient packet interceptor, GPL version
========================================

Prerequisites
-------------

   A Linux kernel source tree is needed to build the packet
   interceptor. The kernel needs to be configured and built before
   building the packet interceptor.

   In the instructions below we assume that this package has been
   unpacked in the user's home directory, i.e. the root directory of
   this package is `~/interceptor-gpl'. If you unpacked the package in
   a different directory, replace `~' with your directory in the
   instructions below.

Building the packet interceptor
-------------------------------

   To build the packet interceptor kernel module follow the steps
   below.

   1. Cd to the interceptor module directory:

         cd ~/interceptor-gpl

   2. Assuming the kernel source tree is located in `/usr/src/linux',
      build the kernel module usig the following command:

         make KDIR=/usr/src/linux

      Leaving out `KDIR' causes the packet interceptor makefile to use the
      source tree of the running kernel:

         make

      This is equivalent to

         make KDIR=/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build

      The Linux `ARCH' and `CROSS_COMPILE' variables can be used to
      build the packet interceptor for another platform. The kernel
      source tree must have been configured and built with the same
      values of these variables. For example, to build for an ARM
      target with cross tools found in the command search path with
      prefix `arm-eabi-':

         make KDIR=/usr/src/linux ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-eabi-

   3. The resulting kernel module is

         ~/interceptor-gpl/vpnclient.ko

   4. To remove all build results:

         make clean
